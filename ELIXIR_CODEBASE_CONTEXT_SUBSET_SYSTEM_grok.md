# A Simple System for Listing Subsets of Files for Features in an Elixir Codebase

Given the challenge of a codebase growing too large to fit into a context window (e.g., for AI tools or code analysis), a system is needed to dynamically select a subset of files relevant to specific features or functionalities. Elixir’s native Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) support offers a powerful way to analyze and manage this process, but for simplicity and practicality, we can propose a straightforward initial approach that leverages existing tools and codebase structure. Below is a proposed system tailored to the provided Elixir codebase, with possibilities for AST enhancement noted for future innovation.

## Proposed System: Module Dependency Analysis with `mix xref`

To manage context efficiently, we can create a system that identifies and lists a subset of files relevant to a particular feature by analyzing module dependencies using Elixir’s built-in `mix xref` tool. This approach is simple, leverages existing Elixir infrastructure, and can be implemented quickly without requiring deep AST manipulation initially.

### Steps of the System

1.  **Identify the Feature’s Entry Point**
    Define the feature by its primary module or function. For example, in the provided codebase, the "BEACON optimization" feature might start with `DSPEx.Teleprompter.BEACON`. The user or system specifies this entry point (e.g., via a configuration file or command-line argument).

2.  **Generate the Dependency Graph**
    Use `mix xref graph --format=pretty` or `--format=dot` to generate a dependency graph of all modules in the codebase. This graph details which modules call or depend on others, providing a map of relationships.

3.  **Traverse the Graph**
    Starting from the feature’s entry point module (e.g., `DSPEx.Teleprompter.BEACON`), traverse the dependency graph to identify all modules it directly or indirectly depends on. Limit the traversal depth (e.g., direct dependencies only or up to a specified level) to control the subset size.

4.  **Map Modules to Files**
    Each module corresponds to a source file in the `dspex/` directory structure (e.g., `DSPEx.Teleprompter.BEACON` maps to `dspex/teleprompter/beacon.ex`). Collect the file paths of all identified modules.

5.  **Return the Subset**
    Provide the list of file paths relevant to the feature, which can then be used to populate the context window.

### Example Application to the Codebase

For the "BEACON optimization" feature:

* **Entry Point:** `DSPEx.Teleprompter.BEACON` (`dspex/teleprompter/beacon.ex`).
* **Run `mix xref graph`:** Reveals dependencies like `DSPEx.Teleprompter.BEACON.BayesianOptimizer` (`dspex/teleprompter/beacon/bayesian_optimizer.ex`), `DSPEx.Services.ConfigManager` (`dspex/services/config_manager.ex`), etc.
* **Traverse Direct Dependencies:** Includes files like `dspex/teleprompter/beacon/bayesian_optimizer.ex`, `dspex/services/config_manager.ex`, and potentially `dspex/example.ex` (for `DSPEx.Example` usage).
* **Resulting Subset:** Files: `["dspex/teleprompter/beacon.ex", "dspex/teleprompter/beacon/bayesian_optimizer.ex", "dspex/services/config_manager.ex", "dspex/example.ex"]`. This subset is significantly smaller than the entire codebase (20+ files), making it manageable for a context window.

## Implementation Sketch

```elixir
defmodule FeatureFileSelector do
  def list_files_for_feature(entry_module, depth \\ 1) do
    # Generate dependency graph (in practice, parse `mix xref graph` output)
    graph = build_dependency_graph()

    # Traverse from entry point
    relevant_modules = traverse_dependencies(graph, entry_module, depth)

    # Map modules to file paths
    modules_to_files(relevant_modules)
  end

  defp build_dependency_graph do
    # Simulated; in reality, parse `mix xref graph --format=pretty`
    # Returns map of module => [dependent modules]
    %{
      "DSPEx.Teleprompter.BEACON" => [
        "DSPEx.Teleprompter.BEACON.BayesianOptimizer",
        "DSPEx.Services.ConfigManager"
      ],
      "DSPEx.Teleprompter.BEACON.BayesianOptimizer" => ["DSPEx.Example"],
      # ...
    }
  end

  defp traverse_dependencies(graph, module, depth, visited \\ MapSet.new()) do
    if depth < 0 or MapSet.member?(visited, module) do
      visited
    else
      deps = Map.get(graph, module, [])
      Enum.reduce(deps, MapSet.put(visited, module), fn dep, acc ->
        traverse_dependencies(graph, dep, depth - 1, acc)
      end)
    end
  end

  defp modules_to_files(modules) do
    modules
    |> Enum.map(fn module ->
      # Convert module name to file path (simplified)
      module
      |> String.replace(".", "/")
      |> String.replace_prefix("DSPEx/", "dspex/")
      |> Kernel.<>(".ex")
      |> String.downcase()
    end)
    |> Enum.uniq()
  end
end
```

**Usage:**

```elixir
FeatureFileSelector.list_files_for_feature("DSPEx.Teleprompter.BEACON")
# => ["dspex/teleprompter/beacon.ex", "dspex/teleprompter/beacon/bayesian_optimizer.ex", ...]
```

## Why This Approach?

* **Simplicity:** Uses `mix xref`, an existing Elixir tool, avoiding complex AST parsing for the initial solution.
* **Practicality:** Works with the provided codebase’s modular structure (e.g., `dspex/teleprompter/beacon.ex`).
* **Dynamic Context:** Automatically adapts to feature-specific needs by following dependencies.
* **Scalability:** Can be extended with depth controls or filters (e.g., excluding test files).

## AST Enhancement Possibilities

While the `mix xref` approach is effective, Elixir’s native AST support could elevate this system for more granular and dynamic context management. Here’s how ASTs could be integrated:

* **AST-Based Dependency Analysis:** Parse each file’s AST using `Code.string_to_quoted/1` to identify module references, function calls, and aliases. Build a precise dependency graph, including function-level granularity (e.g., only include files where `BEACON.compile/5` is called).
* **Feature Tagging via Attributes:** Use module attributes (e.g., `@feature :beacon`) to tag files explicitly. AST traversal extracts these tags, allowing direct feature-to-file mapping.
* **Contractual Interfaces:** Identify behaviours (Elixir’s interface equivalent) like `DSPEx.Teleprompter` in the AST. Include only the interface definition and relevant implementations, excluding unrelated ones (e.g., include `beacon.ex` but not `bootstrap_fewshot.ex` unless needed).
* **Code Summarization:** Extract function specs and module interfaces from the AST, creating a summarized context (e.g., function signatures without bodies). Reduces context size while preserving essential structure.

### Example AST Use Case

For `DSPEx.Teleprompter.BEACON`:

* Parse AST of `beacon.ex` to find calls to `BayesianOptimizer`.
* Include only `beacon.ex` and `bayesian_optimizer.ex`, excluding unrelated files like `benchmark.ex` unless explicitly called.
* Extract `@callback compile/5` from `teleprompter.ex` as the interface, omitting implementation details.

### Contractual Interfaces for Exclusion

The codebase uses behaviours (e.g., `DSPEx.Teleprompter`, `DSPEx.Program`), which can define contractual interfaces. By identifying these in the AST or dependency graph:

* **Include Interface:** Add `teleprompter.ex` for the `@callback` definition.
* **Selective Implementation:** Include only the implementation relevant to the feature (e.g., `beacon.ex` for BEACON, not `bootstrap_fewshot.ex`).
* **Reduce Size:** Exclude unrelated implementations, shrinking the context further.

---

## Future Innovations

* **AST-Driven Feature Detection:** Automatically infer features from AST patterns (e.g., function names, module hierarchies).
* **Dynamic Depth Adjustment:** Use AST complexity metrics to adjust dependency traversal depth.
* **Hybrid Approach:** Combine `mix xref` for coarse filtering with AST for fine-grained analysis.

## Conclusion

The proposed system using `mix xref` offers a simple, effective way to list feature-specific file subsets in the Elixir codebase, addressing the context window size issue. While ASTs aren’t required for this initial solution, they present exciting possibilities for future enhancements, leveraging Elixir’s native support for precise, dynamic context management. This could set a new standard in codebase context handling, starting with Elixir’s unique capabilities.
