Of course. This is a fantastic and highly relevant problem in modern software development, especially when interacting with LLMs. Using Elixir's AST capabilities is a brilliant and very idiomatic approach.

Here is a brainstorm of possibilities for a system to dynamically list a subset of files for a particular feature, as you requested.

### **Project Codename: "Focus" - A Context-Aware File Subsetting System**

The core problem is that a "feature" isn't just one file; it's a web of interconnected modules, structs, and behaviours. We need a system that can trace these connections automatically.

#### **Core Idea: The Feature Context Graph**

The central concept is to model the codebase as a directed graph.

*   **Nodes**: Each Elixir module (`.ex` file) is a node in the graph.
*   **Edges**: A directed edge from Module A to Module B exists if A depends on B.

The "subset of files for a feature" is then found by starting at a "seed" module for that feature and performing a graph traversal to find all connected, relevant nodes.

---

### **Brainstorming the Possibilities**

#### **1. How to Build the Graph? -> AST Analysis (as you suggested)**

This is the most powerful approach. Instead of simple text-based `grep`, we parse the code into its Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). This gives us a structured, semantic understanding of the code.

*   **Process:**
    1.  For each `.ex` file in the codebase...
    2.  Use `Code.string_to_quoted/1` to get the AST.
    3.  Use `Macro.traverse/2` to walk the AST of each module.
*   **What to look for (these become the graph edges):**
    *   **Direct Dependencies:** `alias`, `require`, `import`, `use Module`. These are strong, explicit dependencies.
    *   **Function Calls:** `MyModule.my_function(...)`. This creates a dependency from the current module to `MyModule`.
    *   **Struct Usage:** `%MyStruct{}` or `defstruct [...]`. This creates a dependency on the module that defines the struct.
    *   **Behaviour Implementations:** `@behaviour MyBehaviour` and `@impl MyBehaviour`. This creates a critical link between an implementation and its contract.
    *   **Protocol Implementations:** `defimpl MyProtocol, for: MyType`. Links the protocol, the implementation, and the data type.

This graph would be pre-calculated and stored (e.g., in an ETS table for fast in-memory access) so that querying for a feature's file set is instantaneous.

#### **2. How to Define a "Feature"? -> The Seed**

The system can't magically know what "BEACON" is. The user needs to provide a starting point, or a "seed."

*   **Seed Types:**
    *   **A Module:** e.g., `DSPEx.Teleprompter.BEACON`. This is the clearest seed.
    *   **A Public Function:** e.g., `DSPEx.Teleprompter.BEACON.compile/5`. The system would first find the module for this function.
    *   **A File Path:** e.g., `dspex/teleprompter/beacon.ex`. The system would parse the file to find the module(s) defined within.

#### **3. How to Get the File Subset? -> Graph Traversal & Pruning**

Once we have the seed module, we traverse the graph.

*   **Traversal Direction:**
    *   **Downstream:** Find everything the seed module *uses* (its dependencies). This is the most common need. E.g., `BEACON` -> `BayesianOptimizer` -> `ConfigManager`.
    *   **Upstream:** Find every module that *uses* the seed module (its dependents). This is useful for understanding the impact of a change. E.g., what would break if I changed `DSPEx.Program`?
    *   **Bidirectional:** For full context, a combination of both is often needed, but with a limited depth to prevent pulling in the entire codebase.

*   **The Innovation: Context-Aware Pruning via Contracts (your second point)**

    This is the most exciting part. A simple traversal is good, but it's not smart. We can use contracts to prune irrelevant branches of the graph.

    *   **Identifying Contracts:**
        *   Elixir Behaviours (`@behaviour`) are the primary mechanism.
        *   Protocols (`defprotocol`).
        *   In your codebase, a `use DSPEx.Program` or `use DSPEx.Signature` also acts as a powerful, domain-specific contract.

    *   **Pruning Logic:**
        When the traversal hits a function call that resolves to a *behaviour callback* (e.g., `DSPEx.Program.forward(program, ...)`), the system needs to get smarter.

        1.  It identifies that `forward` is part of the `DSPEx.Program` contract.
        2.  It inspects the *arguments* of the call to find the concrete implementation. In your code, the `program` variable holds the struct of the implementation (e.g., `%DSPEx.Predict{}` or `%DSPEx.Teleprompter.BEACON{}`).
        3.  The traversal now follows the path to that *specific implementation* (`predict.ex` or `beacon.ex`) and **discards all other known implementations of that behaviour.**

    *   **Example from your codebase:**
        *   A feature uses `DSPEx.Client.request(messages, provider: :gemini)`.
        *   The traversal hits `DSPEx.Client`.
        *   The AST analysis is smart enough to see the `provider: :gemini` option.
        *   Inside `DSPEx.Client`, the code might branch to use a specific adapter.
        *   The system knows the "context" is `:gemini`. It will therefore include `dspex/adapters/instructor_lite_gemini.ex` but **it will actively exclude** a hypothetical `dspex/adapters/openai.ex` because it's not part of the current feature's execution path.

#### **Putting it all Together: A Proposed System**

**Name:** `Focus`

**Phase 1: Indexing (Run once or on file changes)**
1.  Fire up a process (e.g., a GenServer) that watches the `lib` directory for changes.
2.  On start/change, it scans all `.ex` files.
3.  For each file, it parses the AST and populates an in-memory graph (ETS) with nodes (modules) and edges (dependencies of all types listed in point #1).

**Phase 2: Querying (The user-facing part)**
1.  A user calls `Focus.get_context("DSPEx.Teleprompter.BEACON")`.
2.  `Focus` takes the seed `"DSPEx.Teleprompter.BEACON"` and finds its node in the graph.
3.  It begins a bidirectional traversal (e.g., 2 levels up, unlimited levels down).
4.  **During traversal:**
    *   If it encounters a link to `DSPEx.Program`, it checks the type of the program being used to select the correct implementation path.
    *   If it encounters a call like `Client.request(..., provider: :gemini)`, it sets a "context hint" for the rest of the traversal, ensuring only `:gemini`-related adapters are included.
5.  The result of the traversal is a `MapSet` of module names.
6.  These module names are mapped back to their file paths.
7.  The final output is a simple list of file paths, ready to be fed to the LLM.

This system would be a massive leap forward. It's not just listing files; it's constructing a "minimum viable context" for a specific feature, using the code's own semantic structure and contractual boundaries to include what's necessary and, just as importantly, exclude what is not.
