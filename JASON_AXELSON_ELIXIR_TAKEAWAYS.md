Of course. Here is a summary of all takeaways from both talks, organized by topic.

### Talk 1: Quick Iteration in Elixir

This talk focuses on improving development speed and efficiency by shortening feedback cycles and mastering your tools.

#### **Core Philosophy & Mindset**
*   **Reduce Feedback Cycles:** The core theme is to shorten the time between making a change and seeing the result. Improving your local development speed compounds and improves the speed of PR reviews, customer feedback, and market feedback.
*   **Care for Your Craft:** Invest time in learning and improving your tools. This pays dividends over your entire career.
*   **Stay in Flow:** A fast and smooth workflow prevents interruptions, helping you maintain a state of flow.
*   **Tool Sharpening:** Dedicate 5-10 minutes daily or weekly to improving your setup (aliases, snippets, etc.). Keep a list of desired improvements so you don't get sidetracked during core work.

#### **IEX (Interactive Elixir) Tips**
*   **`recompile`:** Recompiles your project's source files within an IEX session.
*   **`r(MyModule)`:** Reloads a specific module from its `.beam` file on disk. Use this when `recompile` doesn't work (e.g., if you compiled in another terminal).
*   **Helpers:** Use `h()` for help/docs, `i()` for information on a data type, and `v()` to get previous results.
*   **Interrupt Infinite Loops:** Use the "magic" sequence **`Ctrl+G` -> `i` -> `c`** to interrupt a stuck process and regain control of your shell.
*   **Open Files in Editor:** Set the `ELIXIR_EDITOR` environment variable, then use `open MyModule` or `open MyModule.my_function/1` in IEX to jump directly to the source code in your editor.
*   **`.iex.exs` Configuration:**
    *   Create this file in your project root for project-specific aliases and helpers.
    *   Use a snippet to load a global `~/.iex.exs` file from your project's file for shared settings.
    *   **Alias common functions** (e.g., `alias MyApp.Repo`) to reduce typing.
    *   **Fix charlist printing** with `IEx.configure(inspect: [charlists: :as_lists])`.

#### **Development Workflow & Code**
*   **Modify Dependencies Locally:** To quickly prototype changes in a library, change its entry in `mix.exs` from `{...}` to `path: "deps/the_library"`. This makes the dependency's code part of your project's compilation.
*   **`x-sync` Library:** Automatically recompiles and reloads code in IEX as soon as you save a file. It works for your project code *and* path dependencies, creating an extremely fast feedback loop.
*   **Editor Snippets:** Massively increase your speed. Create snippets for common patterns like:
    *   Labeled `IO.inspect` that includes the filename and line number.
    *   Boilerplate for modules, functions, or tests.
    *   Shorthand for creating map keys where the key and value variable are the same (e.g., `title: title`).
*   **Avoid Compile-Time Dependencies:**
    *   Use runtime configuration (`config/runtime.exs`) instead of compile-time configuration (`config/config.exs`) to prevent full-project recompiles on config changes.
    *   Use `mix xref compile --label "compile-connected" --fail-above 0` in your CI to automatically detect and fail builds that introduce circular compile-time dependencies.

#### **Git Tips**
*   **Use Aliases:** Create short aliases for your most common commands.
*   **`gwip` (Work In Progress):** An alias for `git commit -am "WIP"`. Better than `git stash` because the commit is tied to your branch history and less likely to be lost.
*   **`git reset --hard @{u}`:** Resets your current local branch to match its remote (upstream) version. Much faster than deleting and re-fetching.
*   **`rerere` (Reuse Recorded Resolution):** Enable this Git feature (`git config --global rerere.enabled true`). It remembers how you solved merge conflicts so you don't have to resolve the same conflict repeatedly during a rebase.

#### **Phoenix Tips**
*   **PR Preview Apps:** Set up CI to automatically deploy a unique, seeded instance of your application for every pull request. This is invaluable for designers and other non-technical reviewers.
*   **Reduce Observer Noise:** In `dev.exs`, manually set the number of acceptors for your endpoint and partitions for your LiveView sockets to a low number (e.g., 2). This makes the process tree in Observer much cleaner on multi-core machines.

### Talk 2: Practical Testing in Elixir & Erlang

This talk provides practical, opinionated advice for writing effective, maintainable, and fast tests.

#### **Writing Tests**
*   **Write Tests to Fail Well:** Your assertions should provide useful information on failure. Instead of `assert changeset.valid?`, use `assert changeset.valid? == true` or even better, `assert errors_on(changeset) == []`. The goal is to understand the failure from the CI log without checking out the code.
*   **`actual` on the Left, `expected` on the Right:** Always structure assertions as `assert my_function_call() == :expected_result`. This creates a consistent and readable flow.
*   **Use `async: true`:** Run tests in parallel to make your suite faster. This forces you to find and eliminate global state, leading to better application design.
*   **Avoid Global State to Enable `async`:**
    *   **Problem:** Using the global Application environment for configuration makes tests non-async.
    *   **Solution:** Use the **`process_tree` library** to inject test-specific configuration (like API keys or URLs) into the test process's dictionary. Your application code can read from `process_tree`, which safely falls back to the Application environment in production.
*   **Use `bypass` for HTTP Mocks:** `bypass` creates a mini HTTP server specific to a single test, allowing you to mock external services in an `async`-safe way.
*   **Don't Depend on Factory Defaults:** Tests should not make assertions on default values from a factory (e.g., `assert user.name == "Joe"`). If the factory changes, unrelated tests will break.
    *   **Solution:** Use the **`faker` library** to generate random data in factories. This will immediately break any test that wrongly depends on a hardcoded default.
*   **Structure with Given/When/Then:** Use comments and blank lines to break tests into three clear sections: the setup (`given`), the action being tested (`when`), and the assertions (`then`).

#### **Anti-Patterns to Avoid**
*   **Chasing 100% Test Coverage:** This leads to brittle tests that focus on implementation details rather than business logic. Aim for a healthy percentage (e.g., 80%) and focus on quality.
*   **One Assertion Per Test:** This is inefficient. It's better to group all assertions related to a single logical behavior into one test (e.g., a single "user logs out" test should assert redirection, session change, and flash message).
*   **Using Mocking Libraries (like `meck`):** These libraries work by replacing modules globally, which is a form of global state. This breaks `async: true` and can lead to very difficult-to-debug bugs. Prefer explicit contracts and dependency injection.

#### **Running Tests & Tooling**
*   **`mix test.watch`:** Automatically re-runs your tests when you save a source file, tightening the feedback loop.
*   **Run Tests From Your Editor:** Configure your editor to run the test under the cursor with a single keyboard shortcut.
*   **Run a Single Test by Name:** Use `mix test --only "test should do a thing"` to run a specific test, which is more robust than running by line number.
*   **Visualize Test Performance:** Use the **`xunit_span`** formatter to generate a trace file you can load into Chrome DevTools. This helps you visually identify which tests are slow or are not running in parallel.

#### **Recommended Libraries & Techniques**
*   **`machete`:** Provides powerful assertion matchers like `superset` so you can assert on a subset of a map's keys without worrying about other keys.
*   **`table_test` (or Parameterized Tests):** Define tests using Markdown tables, which is perfect for testing things like user permissions across different roles.
*   **`Nee` (Snapshot Testing):** Instead of writing an assertion, write `auto_assert`. The library runs the code, shows you the result, and asks if you want to "snapshot" that result into a permanent assertion, rewriting the test file for you.
*   **Property-Based Testing (`stream_data`):** An advanced technique where you define general properties of your code (e.g., "reversing a list twice yields the original list") and the library generates hundreds of random inputs to try and prove it false.
